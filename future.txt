Dog Breed Identifier Features

This project is an advanced Dog Breed Identification System
that utilizes deep learning to classify different dog breeds 
from images.The model is built using MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow
Hub, ensuring fast and accurate predictions. The application 
allows users to upload images of dogs and receive instant breed
identification results.

Additional features such as user authentication (login & signup) and a dog food
recommendation system are planned for future updates. The authentication system 
will allow users to create accounts and save their past searches, while the dog
food recommendation feature will provide personalized food suggestions based on
the identified breed. These enhancements will improve the overall user experience
and add more value to the application.
